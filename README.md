# Swimlane UI

## Overview
This project is a Swimlane User Interface (UI) that allows users to drag and drop blocks across different lanes, each representing a distinct stage or state in a process. The UI is highly configurable through a master configuration file, which controls the allowed movements of blocks between lanes based on predefined rules.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Seamlessly move blocks across lanes representing various stages, with restrictions based on master configuration rules.
- **Configurable Swimlanes**: Define allowed and restricted movements via a master configuration file.
- **Block Preview**: Click on any block to view its detailed history, including all previous transitions.
- **Attribute Filtering**: Filter blocks displayed in swimlanes based on specific attributes using the top-level filter mechanism.

## Getting Started

- **Install dependencies**: 
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
-   **Run the app**: 
    ```bash
    npm run dev```
